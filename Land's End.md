## Stage 1
As you walk through the woods, you suddenly come upon a clearing where the trees have been recently felled. There are few quickly errected huts built from nothing more than branches.  A few larger more permanent buildings look like they are in process, but as far as you can see, this is a sorry and hasty camp.

### Rose
She seems to be in charge. A youthful red-headed woman in her middle years, she worked as a innkeepers wife, before she was pulled here. She's friendly and ready to talk your ear off if you let her. She's also super focused on getting the town up to snuff, as she sees it.
