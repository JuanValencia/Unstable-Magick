(Map)

## Stage 1
As you walk through the woods, you suddenly come upon a clearing where the trees have been recently felled. There are few quickly errected huts built from nothing more than branches.  A few larger more permanent buildings look like they are in process, but as far as you can see, this is a sorry and hasty camp.

### Rose May (f.Human)
She seems to be in charge. A youthful red-headed human woman in her middle years, she worked as a innkeepers wife, before she was pulled here. She's friendly and ready to talk your ear off if you let her. She's also super focused on getting the town up to snuff, as she sees it. She can be a bit of a bully.

#### Rumours
* Ca, Gronk, Barmond, and Joth needs help
* There are other towns forming across The Landing, no one knows anything but I've heard:
* Something went wrong with the very fabric of magic. Tearing rents in the multiverse.
* The Gods are punishing us for our pride
#### Quests
* [Pesky Pixies](Pesky Pixies)
* [A Scared Young Boy](A Scared Young Boy)
* [Food Thief](Food Thief)

### Joth WinterBruiser (m.Centaur)
A large centaur warrior with dark skin and brown braided weaves of hair that roll down off of his shoulders. He keeps the camp safe from encroaching wildlife. Serious and dour, he watches the stars for signs of what could have possibily happened. The stars being different disturbs him greatly.

#### Rumours
* The stars are out of alignment. They are unfamiliar, but they tell of pain, lots of pain
* Furious that they let an orc in camp, particularly with that taint of evil magic on him.

### Ca (f.Aarakocra)
She's and old lady whose feathers have lost their sheen. One eye is clouded over, and she misses her children, who didn't get pulled to The Landing. She hopes they're somewhere in Land's End, and would love to go somewhere up in the mountains to live, but doesn't want to go herself. She has a sharp personality and creeps people out.

#### Rumours
* No-one knows where they landed, what happened to their families, how to go home

### Gronk (m.Half-Orc)
He was a Shaman-in-training, but the Great Pull has him going through an existential crisis. He is throwing himself into his work to ignore what he's going through and secretly bears a crush on Rose. Being alone, and not fully Orc, his commitment to Land's end is replacing the commitment to his people. He bears guilt about this though.

#### Rumours
* Rose is beautiful (not spoken but evident by mooning)
* People in town are a bunch of softies, except perhaps Joth, but he doesn't like me much --- and Barmond, but he doesn't like anyone
* The spirits are wrong here. They are young, not old. It's very confusing.

### Barmond Mafdugiln (m.Dwarf)
This old dwarf lives on the edge of town as a hermit. He longs to dig, but doesn't have the tools. He can smith but not well, and refuses to try without the right tools. He's cranky and doesn't trust anyone.

#### Rumours
None, Barmond just stares you down when asked questions.
