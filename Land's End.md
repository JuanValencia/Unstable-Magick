(Map)

## Stage 1
As you walk through the woods, you suddenly come upon a clearing where the trees have been recently felled. There are few quickly errected huts built from nothing more than branches.  A few larger more permanent buildings look like they are in process, but as far as you can see, this is a sorry and hasty camp.

### Rose May (Human)
She seems to be in charge. A youthful red-headed human woman in her middle years, she worked as a innkeepers wife, before she was pulled here. She's friendly and ready to talk your ear off if you let her. She's also super focused on getting the town up to snuff, as she sees it. She can be a bit of a bully.

### Joth WinterBruiser (Centaur)
A large centaur warrior with dark skin and brown braided weaves of hair that roll down off of his shoulders. He keeps the camp safe from encroaching wildlife. Serious and dour, he watches the stars for signs of what could have possibily happened. The stars being different disturbs him greatly.

### Ca (Aarakocra)
She's and old lady whose feathers have lost their sheen. One eye is clouded over, and she misses her children, who didn't get pulled to The Landing. She hopes they're somewhere in Land's End, and would love to go somewhere up in the mountains to live, but doesn't want to go herself. She has a sharp personality and creeps people out.

### Gronk (Half-Orc)
He was a Shaman-in-training, but the Great Pull has him going through an existential crisis. He is throwing himself into his work to ignore what he's going through and secretly bears a crush on Rose.
