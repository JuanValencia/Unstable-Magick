[The Boar's Rest Road](The Boar's Rest Road)

As you approach the village the road grows wider and more well trodden, compared to Land's End, this settlement is not much bigger, but it seems as though people live here. There are a few new cottages that look well built, and the people do not look as haggard. However, as you get closer still, you notice that the people are rather short. They are all halflings.

## Villagers

### Sam Wiseman (M, Elder, Amiable, likes to chat, host visitors)
#### Rumors
* I can always count on Elfi. She has a good head on her shoulders, me I just listen to peoples problems
* Lin's no end of troubles, almost everybody has gotten entangled in one of her schemes
* Barzor coordinates the guard. These woods haven't been our friends.
* Sanhorn, at the lumberyard has been having trouble in the woods lately, our ability to get housing for everyone has suffered.
* Xanola's our hedge doctor if you need any help along those lines.
* Other people have come, but most have moved on. Apparently too many halflings in one place weirds them out <Shrug>. There's a fishing village west of here. I think some Orcs have created tribes in the mountains. Humans have gone south, Elves have gone East. Funny how different folks have gone their own ways.
* We've sent scouts pretty far now. There's a coastal road to our west, a mountain range north ---  we've even seen a volcano!
* If you follow the river you'll reach a large lake in the mountains. I hear it's beautful, but dangerous
* I think we're on a giant island, or perhaps a peninsula.  We haven't gotten too far, but if you go east enough, you'll get to the water eventually, and from the mountains, you can see the North shore.  We haven't been south too far, but I suspect people in Land's end will go southward eventually. As far as I know it's all forrest down there.
* Morgoth is quiet, but I value his wisdom and friendship
#### Quests
* Talk to the people in town
* We lost contact with the mines to the North, we need iron, even just a little for construction and weapons!
