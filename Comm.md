TKE: Technical Knowledge and Experience -> Just having this is not enough, you will be overlooked.

The book *Strong Magic* taught me. (Showmanship === communication skills)

Improve the showmanship to bring it up to your technical skills to actually give that value to others. Also the ability to communicate the value of others, and the value of yourself. Without good communication, there is a great cost, because much of you does not make it to the next person.

When you get good at both TKE & communication, reality becomes negotiable.

Speakers get paid a lot b/c the ability inspire, communicate, etc, is the most highly valued skillset in the world. Your ability to influence and communicate is the most valuable skill in the world.

You can inject this in both personal and professional life.

When you can't communicate, you tend to blame others for the lack of results, you remove from yourself the power to stay in control.

(extreme positivity and self-humility during conversation)

Universal Laws:
1. Know all 88 keys of your instrument
	1. Play your instrument (voice), don't just use it.
	2. People think that playing with their whole voice they are inauthentic --- this is a lie that stops the full use of your instrument.
	3. Practice the unused keys, and use them to get effect.
2. Only practice leads to improvement
	1. This is not just cerebral, it needs doing
	2. You can change your voice to sound the way you want it to by changing your behaviors and practicing them
	3. You don't currently have your natural voice, you have your habitual voice. Your natural voice is the full instrument, well practiced, and well developed.
	4. Don't be so attached to who you are in the present, that you don't give your future self a chance
3. Golden Rule of Communication:
	1. If what you do distracts people from the message, it's a problem.
	2. When you have habitual behaviors, they become invisible.
	3. Watching videos allows you to see the behaviors, and work on removing them.
		1. Audio (don't watch)
		2. Visual (mute sound)
		3. transcript (evaluate the words only)
	4. The smallest invisible and habitual behaviors are the ones that hold us back --- small changes can absolutely transform how people receive you and it's only a matter of practice. Don't think you can't do it, it's just a habit that you can change.
4. Contextual confidence
	1. If you master this sooner, it will serve you for the rest of your life.
	2. Communication skills can transfer beyond your immediate professional context, and can help you better value others as you communicate the value that you see in them effectively.

Give yourself the permission to dream.  Imagine being able to command attention whenever you want to, how different would your life be?

How are you going to change the world?
