* Mortimer - leader of WISE

* Bob Smiles - Human male. Friendly and unassuming.  Has lots of armor, he's an excellent smith and employs a variety of humans and dwarves. Makes +1 items, could make +2 but would require time, money, and graphite/silver/gold/steel/mithril, etc.

## Research Lab
The research lab is the hub of unstable magick.  There is a slot for the font-key on each  of 3 major pillars.  They must be deactivated in order to shut off the crazy magick.  Left, Right, Middle.  Only Alara knows this.  There are wonderous items being researched here, but they are all affected by instability.

## Treasury
An accident filled the treasury with Daemons.

## Market
Filled with the overflow from the city. Some very nice items can be found here, but it takes some digging and time given the disarray.

## Collapsed towers
Throught the city. Places for loot.  Demons, abberations seem to be common.  A hint of the times.
