The wolves were killed except for 1 sympathetic wolf who held back.

There are 3 dire wolves that have been taking all the prey. They are led by an enraged druid who feels like all the villages cropping up are unnatural. (Level 3+ encounter)

## Staff of birdcalls (wolves)

This wooden staff is decorated with bird carvings. It has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause it to create one of the following sounds out to a range of 60 feet: a finch's chirp, a raven's caw, a duck's quack, a chicken's cluck, a goose's honk, a loon's call, a turkey's gobble, a seagull's cry, an owl's hoot, or an eagle's shriek.

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff explodes in a harmless cloud of bird feathers and is lost forever.

You call out to the spirits of nature to aid you. When you cast this spell, choose one of the following effects:

    If there are any tracks on the ground within range, you know where they are, and you make Wisdom (Survival) checks to follow these tracks with advantage for 1 hour or until you cast this spell again.

    If there is edible forage within range, you know it and where to find it.

    If there is clean drinking water within range, you know it and where to find it.

    If there is suitable shelter for you and your companions within range, you know it and where to find it.

    Send the spirits to bring back wood for a fire and to set up a campsite in the area using your supplies. The spirits build the fire in a circle of stones, put up tents, unroll bedrolls, and put out any rations and water for consumption.

    Have the spirits instantly break down a campsite, which includes putting out a fire, taking down tents, packing up bags, and burying any rubbish.

## Wand of Scowls (Owlbear Druid)
This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and target a humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or be forced to scowl for 1 minute.

The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand transforms into a Wand of Smiles.
