Rising up out of the ground is what looks to be an ancient stone altar. Around the altar are 4 stone thrones, each with a different gemstone welded to the back of the seat: An emerald (wind), a ruby(fire), a sapphire (water), and a malachite (earth).

The altar is bare, unmarred, it looks out of place, as if it existed in the hall of a king, not in the middle of the wilderness. The only note on it's age is an inscription (In the year 154, of the first age, DC 15 to know that we're in the 4th age)

When the four seats are filled by those who are attuned to the element, it opens a portal to one of the planes in the center of the altar. (Air, Earth, Fire, Water)
