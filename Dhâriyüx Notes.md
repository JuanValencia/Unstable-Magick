I want to use dialog and communication to solve problems and avoid violence and conflict, BUT deep down there's so much anger, frustration, injustince, a sense of never belonging, and a hunger for vengeance that comes out as a firey rage when I lose control (this is not random and chatotic, it's more when I deal with people with whom I cannot reason).
