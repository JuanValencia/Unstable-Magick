Evil races

Coranton Dilambra, a elite drow elf warrior from a no-name house found a home in the swamps outside Riverton. When ripped from the underdark, he had been entrusted by Zandiil, a great necromancer, with an Amulet of the dead.  In this new world, Coranton has found many uses as he has consolidated a great drow army strengthened by the undead in the middle of Devil's Swamp.

He carries a "Wet Trident" (1d10 - agility weapon, on touch a person feels as thought they are drowning, movement speed is halved, they are mute, only able to choke. The effect lasts until the user clears their throat, 1d4 + 2 rounds, or about 30 seconds. Creatures from the plane of fire take an additional 2 rounds to recover.)

Coranton has been touched by the beholders, and is imbued with the elemental plane of water.

-----
Elantra Disandra, a minor priestess of Loth has allied herself with Coranton. 

Matron Disandra, unwilling aid to Coranton, but immensely powerful with Loth --- she's in the same boat and is pushing Coranton to free them all from the unholy influence of false Gods. (correct but incorrect, she thinks of the avatars as the 'gods' in charge). 

[Amulet of the Dead](https://www.dndadventure.com/html/magic_items/mi_amulet_of_the_dead.html)

```
Abilities: the amulet is made of 3 separate parts, left, right, and the gem stone. Each have their own powers and when put all together create a 4th power. It is made from an unkown smooth stone with a quartz like gem in its center.

The left side of the amulet allows the casting of one improved animate dead spell like ability once per week. creatures raised by this power are +1 hit dice, +1 melee, +1 damage and suffer no initiative penalty (zombies)

The right side of the amulet allows a true necromancer to control triple his normal amount of undead as under the animate dead spell.

The gem protects the wearer from undead, they must make a will power save (DC 27, death magic 2E) in order to attack the wearer.
