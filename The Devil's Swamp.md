Coranton Dilambra, a elite drow elf warrior from a no-name house found a home in the swamps outside Riverton. When ripped from the underdark, he had been entrusted by Zandiil, a great necromancer, with an Amulet of the dead.  In this new world, Coranton has found many uses as he has consolidated a great drow army strengthened by the undead in the middle of Devil's Swamp.
