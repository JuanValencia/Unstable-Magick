# About

Perhaps the best-known and most elusive of all fey creatures, pixies live in the deepest, most pristine forests, but their insatiable curiosity often leads them far from home. Most pixies stand just over 2 feet tall-though they typically fly about the eye level of creatures they’re conversing with in order to maintain eye contact-and weigh about 30 pounds. Pixies talk quickly and easily become overexcited.
