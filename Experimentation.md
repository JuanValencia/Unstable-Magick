The [Great Mother](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Mother)'s children are a chaotic and varied set of beholders.  Though they often differ in ability, they are inherantly chaotic, intelligent, and evil.

Four beholders, after escaping the sub-planes of the Abyss formed a collegial rivalry of sorts --- as much as chaotic beings can form attachments. They each aspired to show dominence of intelligence over the others, each having their own specialties.

Grom, covered in mud, tar, and acid focused on the plane of Earth. He understood golems, the manipulation of dirt & rocks, and how tectonic plates formed and moved at scales beyond imagining, giving him powers over gravity. Even though he appears slow, his intellect is lightning quick as he ponders weighty matters. He is more grounded, even possible more neutral than his bretheren.

Claire, a vain creature with a sparkling aura and wings focused on the plane of air. She understands arcane cold, and how the breadth of life inbues every creature. While she seems self-absorbed, she is actually quite astute. She can whip flame into a blaze, or freeze water into ice, even shattering it.

Favio is a hot-head, literally. He has devoted himself to the study of the plane of fire to the exclusion of almost all else. Volatile in temperment, he has trouble focusing, but he has no trouble manipulating heat in any way, even melting stone.

Katarina is amorphous. Vain like her sister Claire, she does not realize she is not pretty at all. She studies the plane of water, calling forth beings from the waves as easily as wizards cast cantrips. She can call water out of the air, create ice, and bring copious amounts of water to bear in any situation.

All of these greater beholders employ beholders and spectators to do their bidding and act as their messangers.

# Party

As our party grew in stature, the greater beholders watched, each picking a test subject.

Favio, being rash, just grabbed the one who seemed the most like fire. Dhariyush was a perfect subject in many ways, wanting to be more attuned to fire.  Favio wanted to see how far he could manipulate the plane of fire into a specific being, perhaps using it to undermine his sibling's work.

Katarina and Claire noted Favio's work and wanted to counter his manipulations. They chose Eletha due to her antagonistic relationship with Dhariyush at times.

Grom took a while longer to decide and kept his workings secret... at least, for now.
