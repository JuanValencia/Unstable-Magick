"Our world has been marching toward the dawn of a new age! With the advancement of advanced dweomercraft, we have been able to create magical constructions never thought possible by our ancestors. In the areas of transportation, medicine, and even entertainment, our artifacts are making magic more commonplace and more useful. In these later times, the great archmage Alara has created the font-stones --- great gemstones that pull magick from the surrounding ether to store it for later use. Artifacts that are paired with these stones need no charging and can be used by the meanest peasant. Imagine, a farmer with a wand that can cure their livestock and never needs refilling. Indeed, these are great times!"

~From a recent copy of _Kindom Times_

"The Wizarding Institute for the Study of Enchantments (WISE) has gathered together to construct the first intercity gateway using those font-stones. They meet with the beautiful archmage this afternoon to discuss the details of construction --- Don't worry! I won't bore you with the drudgery! But I will tell you that a few of them were looking a bit green with envy as they jockeyed for who would get to be in the summoning circle!"
