# World
You would think that our story starts in the capital city of [A'Ethel](A'Ethel) on the ancient continent of [Keyzun](Keyzun). The great font-stones are creating an opportunity for new industry and alongside them, opportunities for the --- less savory. Enchanters and Artificers are driving this new economy. Those who make a living through magic are being drawn by the hundreds. Some have called this the dawn of a new age. There are rumors of course --- but they're just rumors --- of an extensive underground being built where less savory crafts are practiced in the shadows.

But that's not where our story starts, because you see, the font-stones --- they did not work like we thought. Roll initiative.

It's a normal day for you, what are you doing? [The Great Pull](The Great Pull)

"Our world has been marching toward the dawn of a new age! With the advancement of advanced dweomercraft, we have been able to create magical constructions never thought possible by our ancestors. In the areas of transportation, medicine, and even entertainment, our artifacts are making magic more commonplace and more useful. In these later times, the great archmage Alara has created the font-stones --- great gemstones that pull magick from the surrounding ether to store it for later use. Artifacts that are paired with these stones need no charging and can be used by the meanest peasant. Imagine, a farmer with a wand that can cure their livestock and never needs refilling. Indeed, these are great times!"

~From a recent copy of _Kindom Times_

"The Wizarding Institute for the Study of Enchantments (WISE) has gathered together to construct the first intercity gateway using those font-stones. They meet with the beautiful archmage this afternoon to discuss the details of construction --- Don't worry! I won't bore you with the drudgery! But I will tell you that a few of them were looking a bit green with envy as they jockeyed for who would get to be in the summoning circle!"

~News from the "Red Bard", Jervis

"Mortimer has shown himself to be far more responsible than our beloved archmage who tends towards too much magic in too many hands -- it will disrupt the social order. WISE would like to recommend that Mortimer begins an audit of all the font-stone projects, with an eye toward more sane policies."

~A joint statement from the WISE elders
