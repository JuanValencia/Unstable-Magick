"Our world has been marching toward the dawn of a new age! With the advancement of advanced dweomercraft, we have been able to create magical constructions never thought possible by our ancestors. In the areas of transportation, medicine, and even entertainment, our artifacts are making magic more commonplace and more useful. In these later times, the great archmage Alara has created the font-stones --- great gemstones that pull magick from the surrounding ether and storing it for later use. Artifacts that are paired with these stones need no charging and can be used by the meanest peasant. Imagine, a farmer with a wand that can cure their livestock and never needs refilling. Indeed, these are great times"
