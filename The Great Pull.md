_Roll Initiative_

Tell me about your typical day...

As you were ____________________, you suddenly feel the air, as if it were no longer outside you. It tickles your skin and feels as though a static charge were filling the air. 

Make a constitution saving throw.

**< 10**: You are violently ripped from existence and take 1d6 force damage and 1d4 psychic damage, you lose consciousness

**< 15**: You feel yourself being pulled from this existence and find yourself floating above thick leaves and under enormous trees, you drop several feet and take 1d6 force damage

**else:** You fill dizzy for a moment as the world spins, and as your eyes settle, you find yourself in the middle of vast forrest. You are surrounded by trees and small the damp clean smell of wet leaves. You cannot see the sun or sky through the forrest canopy.
