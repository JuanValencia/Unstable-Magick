The continent of Keyzun resides in the material plane.

For most of your lives, you have known nothing but. The continent is massive, taking 1-2 months via fast horse to travel from tip to tip, though the dangers along the way would make that kind of reckless speed almost impossible. In reality, most cities and towns reside in the central and more temperate part of the continent.

To the northwest, with much colder lands, lives barbarian tribes and what feels like an endless frost. To the northeast one reaches the Giant's Steps, and while less cold, arguably more dangerous as the tribes of Giants feud endlessly in the cold wastes.

To the west lies a vast wilderness in the tropical jungles that stretch out from all the surrounding coasts. Many strange and wild things live there.

To the southeast lies the ancient parts of the world.  Most stories have all of civilization starting there, but the things that inhabit those lands are themselves ancient now, and terribly dangerous. Dragons, beholders, undead, and more live there.

In the centralmost part of the continent is the great food belt that supplies all the people of Keyzun with food aplenty, and ultimately the armies of Keyzun keep the encroaching wilderness at bay.
