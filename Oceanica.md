A town of mostly elves trying to escape the weirdness. They've been here about 1 year.

## Villagers

### Elazumin stillcloud (m) - slight, but hearty for an elf, with bronze skin, and blonde hair. His ice blue eyes seem to look past you as he stares out, often towards the sea.
#### Rumors
* The sea is full of tales, the song of sea is fresh and new. It is so different from Keyzun, which is ancient and old.
* We have meditated long on what's become of us. It's clear the font-stones bent magic in a way that they should not have. They have created gaps in the Ether. Gaps which bend the planes and make the gaps between them thin.
* I believe we have some distant elf kin in the forrest, but they are recluse and more deeply tied to the land than we.
* Perhaps we could sail further? But for now, we have found nothing else besides this island --- Wenys has mapped out much, you should see her.
* Brynnia is older than any of us and wise, though a bit aloof.

#### Quests
* A trade treaty with the other tows would be helpful, but we are almost too proud to admit it. Perhaps you can help me gain support?
* We have found a trove of sorts out in the water. Talk to Wynn, our feast-warden
