### Test of Sacrifice

### Description of the Frostfire Amulet

The Frostfire Amulet is an ancient and enigmatic artifact, embodying the duality of ice and fire. It appears as a circular pendant, with one half crafted from a deep blue, almost translucent ice that never melts, and the other half a vibrant, glowing ember, eternally burning yet cool to the touch. The two halves are seamlessly joined, symbolizing the balance between opposing forces. Encircling the perimeter are runes that shift between fiery orange and icy blue, hinting at the amulet's deep connection to elemental magic.

### The Event: The Silent Choice

As soon as a member of the party lays their hand upon the Frostfire Amulet, a sudden silence envelops the group. Their voices vanish, rendering them unable to speak or make any sound. In this eerie quiet, a voice resonates within their minds, clear and compelling, yet devoid of any identifiable source.

**Voice in the Mind**: "Chosen ones, you stand at the threshold of power and wisdom. The Frostfire Amulet recognizes your journey and offers you a test. Your choices shall shape your destinies. Speak not with your voices, for they are bound, but with your hearts and minds."

The party realizes that they must collectively decide on a test by silently agreeing on a choice. As they focus on a test (Sacrifice, Unity, Wisdom, Courage, or Temperance), the amulet's runes glow in response, affirming their selection.

Once the test is chosen, the voice presents them with a scenario aligned with their chosen test. They must silently deliberate and come to a unanimous decision on how to respond. Their choices during this mental and moral deliberation are crucial and will determine the rewards and curses they receive.

The entire event is a profound and introspective journey, emphasizing the power of silent communication and the weight of choices. It serves as a reminder that the strongest connections and decisions often lie beyond spoken words, rooted in the shared understanding and unity of purpose.
