## Dhariyush
Dhariyush is full of rage, and is upset that archives at WISE have been tampered with. He wants to know what happened to his clan.

Dhariyush is always searching for things to get stronger:

Uncommon Magic Items
-Stone of Good Luck
-Bloodwell Vial (+1)

Rare Magic Items
-Bloodwell Vial (+2)
-Barrier tattoo (15+2 AC)

Very Rare Magic Items
-Tome of Leadership and Influence
-Bloodwell Vial (+3)
-Barrier tattoo (18 AC)

Legendary Magic Items
-Robe of the Archmagi
-Cloak of invisibility

He has come upon a cursed gem. This gem makes him attuned to fire, resistant even.  However, it makes him scary.  The more he embraces his rage, the more powerful the resistance becomes, eventually manifesting in a fiery feline that executes his wrath.

## Velea

Wolf friend - spells of the druids are absorbed by the wolf somehow.

Eletha's font-stone and Jorc's abilities can combine to fashion a new arm. This would increase strength corresponding to quality of the arm.

## Salali

Thieves are active in A'Ethel and would use her again. They promise more info about her past. (Really they use her to get stuff for WISE and ultimately beholder)

## Jorc
Jorc is distractable and is learning how to make potions.  He knows that bat guano, and a ruby do something, but he cannot figure out what. As it turns out, with a potion of etherealness and an obsidian focus (consumed), he could make a minor font-stone that could power certain items for the party. However, these are [Unstable](Unstable).  Through experimentation, he may be able to improve the instability, but it is an unsure thing.

He is currently experimenting with potion making and may have additional [random effects](https://randomtablesrpg.com/fantasy/d100-random-potion-table-for-5e-dnd/) on his potions, until he learns them well from someone else.  He is able to more effectively learn potions from mushroom effects that he has sampled.

## Eletha
She has a special relationship with the Orcs. She knows their ways and trusts them. Grock and Zhora are particularly good friends, and due to her familiarity with Orcs, has advantage in dealing with them.  The Orcs have a natural & supernatural affinity for the magick of the world. They shun the dwoemercraft from [A'Ethel](A'Ethel) as unnatural, though they do not know why.  Once [The Great Pull](The Great Pull) happens, they are committed to destroying they city and what they believe is the source of the calamity that followed.  They want Eletha to join them in that task.

Eletha happens to hold the font-key, though she doesn't know much else than that she was exiled for it. The font-stones were shut off in an emergency measure in [A'Ethel](A'Ethel). The font-key can turn them on again.

## Abe
Clockwork sorceror whose brother, Zachariah, is working with WISE in an unknown capacity. [Ladriph](Ladriph), a "regular" beholder is controlling WISE in service to [Kahldrucatholn](Kahldrucatholn).  Zachariah is gaining power through Ladriph's influence. By unbalancing the magical laws, Zachariah can harness the chaos in powerful ways. Ladriph uses this to gain more influence in the world to study it better.  If Abe is able to stabilize the magical weaves around [Keyzun](Keyzun), [Primus](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Primus) will reward him in a corresponding measure. 

Zachariah's experiments were the impetus for both Abe and Zachariah to gain their powers, though Abe doesn't know it. It's possible that by stopping Zechariah, Abe could lose his own powers.

Abe currently has an animated suit of armor following him around. He has been able to program it to follow, and attack anyone he attacks 1 time.

Abe currently is cursed with beard growth. He always maintains an 18 inch long beard.
