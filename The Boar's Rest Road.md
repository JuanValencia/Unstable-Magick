As you walk along the path you note that the terrain is getting hilly and starting to rise. The forrest thins out just a little bit and turns more deciduous. There are many rivulets criss-crossing along the sides of the path and throughout the woods. Distantly, you can hear the sounds of a river somewhere.

The road the The Boar's Rest has become hunted by grungs. We need that road clear to ensure the moving of supplies. 8 medium, 2 grungs + 1 elite grung, 3 grung wildlings are guiding the grungs to attack --- one as written, one which exchanges spike trap for spitting poison (orange), one which is spitting poison (purple)

Blue Grung (artisan, 11-14). The poisoned creature must make a loud noise at the start and end of its turn.

Gold Grung (leader, 20). The creature is charmed by the grung and can speak Grung.

Green Grung (laborer, 1-10). The poisoned creature can’t move except to climb or make standing jumps. If the creature is flying, it can’t take any actions or reactions unless it lands.

Orange Grung (elites). The poisoned creature is frightened of its allies.

Purple Grung (manager, 18-19). The poisoned creature feels a desperate need to soak itself in liquid or mud. It can’t take actions or move except to do so or to reach a body of liquid or mud.

Red Grung (mage, 15-17). The poisoned creature must use its action to eat if food is within reach.
