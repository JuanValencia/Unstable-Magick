A town of mostly humans. Some have been here almost 20 years (some even born here!), some have been here for just a few weeks.
The settlement is booming however and there are kids everywhere. There are farms, a blacksmith, armormer, shops of various sorts.

### Boj Men (m) - Frontiersman, who has earned the respect of his fellow men. Broad and dark. Tough as nails, slightly suspcious of outsiders.
#### Rumors
* We've made a life for ourselves here and now. I'm more concerned with babies and funerals and weddings than getting back.
* We trade with a variety of fishing villages along the coast and have explored almost the whole island. We stay away from the deep forest, the swamp, the mountains and hills. The midlands and coast are generally safer.
* We have a thriving economy. There's a general store, blacksmith, mill, several farms.
* We have a pretty well trained militia (pride)
* We're self sufficient, so we don't really trade with anyone other than the fishing villages. More trouble than it's worth.
* The swamp nearby is filled with vicious critters. Rumors tell of one vicious drow who wears fire as a cloak and carries a burning trident. I fear for what that portends.
#### Quests
* [Monsters at the Farms](Monsters at the Farms)
* (Later) - Gilon is causing problems, quietly take him out.

### Albert Ironstone (m) - Blacksmith, quiet
#### Rumors
* I hear there's a blacksmith of some skill that landed in Land's End, the new place in the dense woods. I bet it's all hogwash... [sweating]
