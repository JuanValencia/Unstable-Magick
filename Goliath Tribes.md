## Gol`Kek
Braveheart and Trueshot's tribe. The tribe feels a great loss at what happened when Velea lost her arm and trueshot died. They simply have no words. At seeing Velea again, they are impressed at how strong he has become, but at the same time, have a hard time looking at his arm. It's awkward and sad.

### Vimga 'BrokenHeart' (Formerly 'StrongArm') Kakane-Une
Velea's Mother. She is huge and strong. Misses her son terribly and resorted to drinking heavily when Velea left. Velea's father Ul`tat died a long time ago, so Vigma is a widow -- in Goliath culture this is fine as she is plenty strong enough to take care of herself.
