# Kai`Leen

On the SouthWestern shore of the unnamed isle in the northest reaches of the Fae Sea.
From a ways offshore you seee what at first appears to be a towering fortress reaching up to the sky. But as you fall within its shadow and the glare from the sun subsides, you see that each stone, if you can call it that, is actually it's own room or building brick.  The whole thing looks like it was cobbled together from all the refuse of the sea and all the traded goods of ship captains the world over. It's at once both impressivevely monumental and apparently flimsy.  Closer inspection reveals that some of the "blocks" are even under construction, or have big gaping holes. 

In the center of the grotto is a tremendous park that is strictly patrolled, the only section that is.  It is the pride of the neighborhood and every gang respects it.

There are four warring gangs, mostly split by race, and all controlled by a heavy handed Jarl. An Orcish "FistBorns" (fighters led by Jarl Jr.), a shorter races "KnifeGuts" (rogues led by "The Knife" whom no one has ever seen), an elvish/human "Enterprisers" (merchants, bards & archers led by Julia f.human), and an alt-colored race's "Whisperers" (who specialize in magic led by Tonassi, f. tiefling).
