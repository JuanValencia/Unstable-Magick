## Storm Giant Throne

## Storm Giant Hoarde
Many treasures from raids over the centuries.  In particular, they have a gem that glows with an inner light. They don't know what it is other than it's clearly magical.  Archmage A'lara would recognize it as the [Beholder's Gem](Beholder's Gem). (When a beholder looks at you, you can look back at it.) The beholders have never had an interest in the giants, so they're not really looking, so the giants never figured it out. A'lara noted that beholder magic was behind some of the observations she made when the font-stones started showing instability, and she is trying to chase down every lead.  Once Alara finds the gem, she will translocate back to A`Ethel to do research in the Hall of Magic.
