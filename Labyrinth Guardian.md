- **Immutable Form**. The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
- **Magic Resistance**. The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

About

This icy statue stands a head taller than a normal human. A rime of frost coats it, and razor-sharp shards of ice adorn its limbs.

The ice golem is a humanoid formed of roughly chiseled ice, standing 10 feet tall and weighing around 800 pounds. Ice golems at rest appear to be normal ice sculptures and are often mistaken as such, but a DC 15 [Wisdom](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom) ([Perception](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check will notice that the creature is alive.

An ice golem usually opens combat with its breath weapon. An ice golem never uses weapons or wears armor, preferring to attack with its powerful fists. Fire is an effective means of combating these creatures.
